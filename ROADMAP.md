# Roadmap

* Acessing members *(eg. identifier.member)*
* GoTo Definition
* Order Completions by closeness
* Exclude unreachable completions / Respect Scope
* Include Type Information onHover and onComplete
* Include Docstrings
* Show Compilation Errors w/ lines
* Incorporate File changes while editing
* Better support mid-edit compilation / intellisense

### Silly Ideas

* Website hosted w/ pony-h2
* Switch to pony based pony compiler
* Reuse previous AST-Trees when edited files change
